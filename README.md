# SafeCloud Gateway

###### What is SafeCloud Gateway?

The SafeCloudSMP gateway is the core of the SafeCloudSMP service network, linking all our services together.

## Features

- Internal Discord bot powered by [Disploy](https://disploy.dev) for basic Discord integration.
- [The website](https://safecloud.quest), as this is a Next.js app, we also built the website inside the gateway.
- SMP User system, allowing users to link their Minecraft account and Discord account to their SMP account, allowing for effortless moderation and syncing of roles across the Discord and Minecraft server.
