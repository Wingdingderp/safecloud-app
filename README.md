# TSMP Gateway

###### What is TSMP Gateway?

The TristanSMP gateway is the core of the TristanSMP service network, linking all our services together.

## Features

- Internal Discord bot powered by [Disploy](https://disploy.dev) for basic Discord integration.
- [The website](https://tristansmp.com), as this is a Next.js app, we also built the website inside the gateway.
- Admin API for microservices such as [Natsirt](https://github.com/TristanSMP/Natsirt) to interact with the gateway.
- Wings API for minecraft server -> gateway communication.
- [Companion](https://tristansmp.com/companion) API for minecraft client -> gateway communication. 
- TSMP User system, allowing users to link their Minecraft account and Discord account to their TSMP account, allowing for effortless moderation and syncing of roles across the Discord and Minecraft server.
- The [TristanSMP market](https://tristansmp.com/market), inspired by the Steam community market, allows users to buy and sell items in-game for diamonds.
